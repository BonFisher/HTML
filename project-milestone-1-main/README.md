## Project Goals
The primary goal of this website is to teach the audiance about the two main formats of the cardgame Cardfight Vanguard. There are two main demographics this project is trying to apeal to and they are: New players and returning vanguard players, from my experiance and research i have found out there is alot of information on how to start playing but no singular resource the brings that all together. This website will aim to fix that by linking other community resources. this will be more beneficial for new vanguard players that won't know where to look for this available information

### New player goals
- Understand the differences between the two formats the game offers
- will be aware how and where they can search for specific and relevent information

### Returning player goals
- Will build upon previous game knowledge
- act as a central hub for other resources the community has made 

### Developer goals
- I want to create a functioning front end that demonstrates the use of HTML/CSS that has been covered
- I want information to be readily available to my target demographic
- A strong first attempt at making an appealing website that i can display on my portfoilio

## User Stories
as a returning vanguard player aged 18 - 25 i want:
- them to easily understand the current state of both formats with advice on where to find resources to get back into the game 
- a concice explanation and example on all card types so they understand any changes that have happened
- 

## Prerequisites 
- Understanding that the game Cardfight Vanguard exits
- Know how to play the game of Cardfigth Vanguard


## Features
- A Navigation bar to find the relevent section
- Links to other resources
- A basic summery of the two formats
- Images to guide explanations
- videos that can be previewed on the website or viewed on the correct platform



## Testing
### Expected

## Design choices
i have decided to model my design after a website called VG paradox, the biggest reason for this is this is a UI that returning players may be familier with

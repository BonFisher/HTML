        <P>
            <h3> The Two Formats</h3>
            Standard is the main format the game supports and you will find it gets the most official product while naturally having the higher tournament turnout making it easier to find a community in your area. It is generally advised that if you are new to the game you start with this format as it is easier to grasp due to having a smaller cardpool.
            <br>
            Premium is a format that allows all cards that have ever been printed this means unlike standard who only allows cards from standards introduction 3 years ago, premium has access to a further 7 years of cards aswell as dedicated sets. Due to the larger cardpool the game has significantly more player expresion and options which for veteran players or people wanting a more complex format this is ideal.
